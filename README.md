# Tiny-note-player
This project is available both in c language and in avr assembly code. It is a simple program written for the AVR Attiny85 microcontroller. It allows the microcontroller to store a sequence of notes in the program memory. For each note must be specified a frequency and a duration. <br > The microcontroller will output a voltage corresponding to the actual note to play through the PB0 pin. A buzzer must be connected to that pin. <br >
Also an LED could be driven by the microcontroller. Any pin other than the PB0 can be set to control it.
